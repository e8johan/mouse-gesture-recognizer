Lots of thanks to quard (Irek Khasyanov) for his contributions.

This is an implementation of a mouse gesture algorithm. The 
gesture recognizion part is separated from the Qt GUI and can 
be used regardless of toolkit or platform.

The Qt GUI has been developed and tested using Qt 4.

If you use this package in your application I would love to 
know about it. Feel free to drop a mail!
